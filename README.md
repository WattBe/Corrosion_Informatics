## Summary of the Project

(Excuses to the original Autor) This is project to present as Capstone. Therefore I have to create an external stakeholder for which I will have to solve the problem. In this case a Journal had contacted me to prove the accuracy compliance of data published. The study tried different approaches and it is expected in the present study to reproduce the data but also to design a simple neuronetwork. Ultimately Data reliability is to be constatate through this approach.

## Literature Research Background

This project is based on the work by O. V. Mythreyi 1, M. Rohith Srinivaas 2, Tigga Amit Kumar 3 and R. Jayaganthan 1
Machine-Learning-Based Prediction of Corrosion Behavior in
Additively Manufactured Inconel 718 (Data 2021, 6, 80. [Original Article](https://doi.org/10.3390/data6080080)
** Abstract
>This research work focuses on machine-learning-assisted prediction of the corrosion
>behavior of laser-powder-bed-fused (LPBF) and postprocessed Inconel 718. Corrosion testing data of
>these specimens were collected and fit into the following machine learning algorithms: polynomial
>regression, support vector regression, decision tree, and extreme gradient boosting

## Motivation
The motivation for conducting this study is to develop a predictive model that can predict the corrosion behavior of an LPBF component and mathematically compute the contribution Data 2021, 6, 80 3 of 16 arising from each postprocessing treatment in the additive processing cycle. machine learning algorithms were used to predict the electrochemical
behavior of Inconel 718 produced via the additive route.
The __independent__ features considered were heat treatment temperature and duration, shot peening
inclination and velocity

## Dataset
The specimens, thus printed, postprocessed, and categorized, were tested for general
corrosion using an electrochemical method.
